# CorrectionPARAFACinR
Data contains an example of good classified folder, with all matching data between CDOM and FDOM

MissnamedData is an example that will work, but will have a missmatch between 1 CDOM file and 1 FDOM file. To see which file is wrongly associated, you may look it verifyMatches.csv



## Structure of the folders:
Excitation and emission correction csv have to be in the same folder as the .Rproj

FDOM, CDOM and nano files must be in these repositories exactly and respect the case (upper for CDOM and FDOM, lower for nano). FDOM and CDOM files must have the same name
