#'@title Calculate SUVA indice
#'
#'@description This function reads any number of CDOM files and calculate SUVA.
#'You have to manually load DOC file for SUVA
#'Wavelengths chosen based on Helms 2008
#'Calculate spectral slope with a reference wavelength
#'The model use a nonlinear least square fitting routine
#'The equation is abs = abs0 * exp(-S(wavelength - ref.wavelength)) + K as in Markager & Vincent 2000
#'where abs is the absorption coef, abs0 is the reference absorption coef at wavelenth and ref.wavelength
#'S is the slope and K is an additional background parameter to allow baseline to shift 

#'@param FileSelect is a logical parameter to allow you which file to load. Default is FALSE, meaning that all files in /CDOM
#'will be loaded

#DOC must be in mg/L, with sample names as row names and one column with the values
#If DOC is in ÂµM, change "unit" to "uM"
#Column one on CDOM is wavelength (nm) and column two is absorption coefficient
#wl is set at 254 for SUVA254 but can be change to obtain any desired wavelength
#skip is the number of lines to skip before getting the header in CDOM files
