#'@title Generate the spectral slope for CDOM samples
#'
#'@description This function reads any number of CDOM files and calculate their spectral slope.
#'You have to manually load DOC file for SUVA
#'Wavelengths chosen based on Helms 2008
#'Calculate spectral slope with a reference wavelength
#'The model use a nonlinear least square fitting routine
#'The equation is abs = abs0 * exp(-S(wavelength - ref.wavelength)) + K as in Markager & Vincent 2000
#'where abs is the absorption coef, abs0 is the reference absorption coef at wavelenth and ref.wavelength
#'S is the slope and K is an additional background parameter to allow baseline to shift 

#'@param FileSelect is a logical parameter to allow you which file to load. Default is FALSE, meaning that all files in /CDOM
#'will be loaded
#'@param wl0 is the reference wavelength, default is 375 as in Stedmon, Markager and Kaas 2000
#'@param FROM is the wavelenth at which you want to start calculating the exponential fit
#'@param To is the wavelenth at which you want to end calculating the exponential fit
#'@param By is the step between each wavelength
#'@param skip is a parameter to determine how many lines will be skiped before the header in the absorbance files
